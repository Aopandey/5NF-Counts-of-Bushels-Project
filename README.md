# 5NF-Counts-of-Bushels-Project
Architected an advanced 5NF database schema, including both Logical Data Model (LDM) and Physical Data Model (PDM), for meticulously storing and querying Indiana's corn and soybean harvest yields. Utilized SQL for relational database construction, enhancing data retrieval efficiency and integrity. Additionally, crafted a comprehensive technical report detailing the database design and implementation strategy, serving as a critical resource for project management and stakeholder review.
